# The “setup.py” file is specific to the creation of a library: It will indicate to Pypi (the Python Package Index) the version of your library, as well as a lot of other metadata for its referencing.

# Always prefer setuptools over distutils
from setuptools import setup, find_packages

# To use a consistent encoding
from codecs import open
from os import path

# The directory containing this file
HERE = path.abspath(path.dirname(__file__))

# Get the long description from the README file
with open(path.join(HERE, 'README.md'), encoding='utf-8') as f:

# This call to setup() does all the work
